# FlappyBirdLike-Android
This repository contains a FlappyBird like game written entirely in Java, using LJGWL graphics libraries. The game has 2 versions, one built for and compatible with PCs and one for Android mobiles. For the latter I used the Android SDK installed via Android SDK Manager which I have then imported in my project. 

The whole project and necessary configurations to import the libraries were made through Eclipse IDE.
